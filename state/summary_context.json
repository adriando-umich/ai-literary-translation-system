  "characters": [
    "Dorothy: The narrator's wife. Returned to full-time work a year and a half ago. Works a fund-raising job at a law school. Likes to see her husband as an \"inspired author\" and herself as an \"able enabler.\" Says the narrator's cashmere sweater makes his eyes look \"bedroomy.\" Launched an argument about George wearing shorts. Is naturally sympathetic and good at conceding moods, capable of making the narrator feel sheepish by oversympathizing. Resumed her career and was promoted to vice president within eighteen months after following her husband's advice on dressing one step above her rank. Puts herself on Dorothy Junior’s side during hikes but hikes because she likes it. Made a pact with the narrator not to treat their children equally but to love them equally and deal with each situation separately. Told George not to speak to his father in a disrespectful way. Uses the backfire technique constantly, loving to oversympathize with the narrator's mood.",
    "George: The narrator's seventeen-year-old son. Attends a boarding school as a day student. Hates the food at school and his father's stew. Used all the toothpaste. As a two-year-old, he used \"argument by the stick\" (fists) when words failed him. He switched the rhetoric from past to future in an argument about toothpaste. At age seven, insisted on wearing shorts to school in the middle of winter. Made a deal with his father to wear shorts to school if he wore snow pants outside. His birthday was declared \"Shorts Day\" by the principal. Instinctively used Aristotle's three tools of persuasion. Stuck out his lower lip when trying not to cry. Now expresses individuality by wearing ties and pants to school. Believes that meeting a pointless challenge outweighs comfort and sense. Was denied permission to sit with his friends at a football game by the narrator, who cited his age and gender. Tried the *dubitatio* technique the narrator told him about, using it on \"her\" while talking politics. Tried to make the narrator mad by announcing an emotion, which backfired. Got stronger than the narrator in arm-wrestling and learned his grip technique.",
    "Narrator: An unnamed individual who discovered rhetoric through John Quincy Adams's lectures. Is the father of George and husband of Dorothy. A writer who dropped out of journalism and publishing to work by himself in a cabin office in a tiny village in northern New England. Considers himself a \"confirmed hermit,\" \"persuasion-resistant,\" and \"advertising-immune.\" Owns a cat. Created the website Figarospeech.com. Was an editorial director at Rodale publishing company a few years ago. Considers himself a \"lousy prognosticator of best sellers.\" Used the extreme choice technique to persuade his wife to name their son George. Tried to persuade George to wear pants using argument by character, logic, and emotion. Conceded to George to let him wear shorts to school. Was humiliated by losing an argument to a seven-year-old. His personal goal is to raise persuasive children. Had a former boss who used concession effectively. Returned home angry that his employer had not recognized an award his magazine won. Lived in D.C. when single. Carried a coffee mug that said \"Piss Off\" in New York and Greensboro. Hired an entry-level editor with a controversial bumper sticker. Has a younger brother, John. Tried to imitate John's \"doll\" approach with a rose and failed, sensing his own embarrassment. Considers himself not an \"irony-free, straight-ahead guy.\" Worked in a job speaking to business execs and editors. Considered corduroy the height of male fashion. Had a fashion consultant named Joe in New Hampshire. Felt five years old when talking to Captain Kangaroo. Took over a college alumni magazine, increased advertising revenue, but did not receive a raise beyond cost-of-living increases. Clashed with a faculty dean over publishing an article in German, valuing profit and service to readers over scholarship. Apologized to Dorothy Junior to get into the car. Admired Dorothy Junior's use of the Eddie Haskell Ploy. Made a pact with Dorothy not to treat their children equally but to love them equally and deal with each situation separately. Believes girls mature more quickly than boys. His children saw him as practically wise in anything that didn't involve moving parts. Researched Quintilian. Described *dubitatio* to George. Used the \"gradually speak louder\" technique himself due to stage fright. Explained classical rhetoric to a lady after his daughter's temper tantrum. Is scheduled to testify before the New Hampshire legislature on broadband Internet access in rural areas. Has a dial-up connection so slow a stamped envelope gets delivered faster than e-mail. His anger is perceived by Dorothy Junior as \"Yosemite Sam\" funny, but his quiet, scary eyes are frightening. Can make \"scary eyes.\" Worked for a small magazine early in his publishing career that had no fact checkers. Cluelessly placed Mount Saint Helens in Oregon in a news piece. Used the backfire technique on his editor, Bill, after making a mistake. Tries to entertain his family with puns, but they are unappreciative. Is \"hit-or-miss\" with rapid-response humor. His family values an occasional obscenity, skillfully uttered, as a commonplace. Stopped arm-wrestling his son. Was better at arm-wrestling due to knowing the right kind of grip. Is currently consulting with a publishing company that is bidding for a major airline’s in-flight magazine. His client has only one editor dedicated to the project, besides him, and he will help hire staff if the client wins the bid. Plans to pitch the magazine around the word \"fun,\" including \"in-flight cinema\" (flip-book images) and \"competitive doodling.\" Returned a rental car with big scrapes in Nice, France, but the worker in the return lot gave a Gallic shrug and sent him on his way without punishment. Exaggerates for effect when discussing commonplace words.",
    "John Quincy Adams: Taught rhetoric at Harvard College from 1805 to 1809 while a United States senator. He was a \"paunchy, balding thirty-eight-year-old\" during his teaching years and authored a volume on rhetorical lectures.",
    "Cat: The narrator's pet, described as \"ten dumb pounds of fur,\" who persuades with gesture and tone of voice.",
    "Daniel Webster: Studied rhetoric at Dartmouth College by joining the debating society, the United Fraternity (later Alpha Delta).

    "Aristotle: A philosopher who understood the power of emotion as a motivator, believed emotion trumps logic, and believed in the curative powers of seduction. Identified three traits of credible leadership: virtue, disinterest, and practical wisdom. Devised a form of rhetoric for each of the tenses and liked the future best. Identified three most powerful tools of persuasion: logos, ethos, and pathos. Invented logic. Believed every point has its flip side. Quoted as saying, \"He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.\" Believed people must trust a persuader's judgment and essential goodness. Identified three essential qualities of a persuasive ethos: virtue, practical wisdom (street smarts), and selflessness (disinterest). His \"disinterested goodwill\" combines selflessness and likability. Believed emotions come from belief (what we value, know, expect) and that reality looks different under different emotions. Preferred to modify people's emotions through their beliefs. Said some emotions (sorrow, shame, humility) prevent action, while others (joy, love, esteem, compassion) work better. Identified anger, patriotism, and emulation as emotions that can get an audience to act. Called the use of fear a fallacy (\"argument by the stick\"). Said the easiest way to stimulate anger is to belittle a desire. Noted that young, poor, and sick people rouse to anger more easily. Said anger gets the fastest action but is not the best for deliberative argument, reserving it for courtroom rhetoric. Noted that a big crowd expects big drama in a speech. Believed the person most affected by a decision makes the best judge of it. Maintained that a slave’s testimony was invalid except under torture, and would have caned a kid.",
    "David Hume: A philosopher quoted as saying, \"Truth springs from argument among friends.\"",
    "Saint Augustine: Knew that faith requires emotion. A onetime rhetoric professor and one of the fathers of the Christian Church, known for \"boffo sermons\" that made audiences cry. Quoted as saying, \"Audi partem alteram. Hear the other side.\"",

    "Dorothy Junior: The narrator's daughter. Enjoys argument much less than her brother. Can be equally persuasive. Uses guilt as an emotional goal in arguments. Is spending a term as a college student in London. Has a biting tongue but knows how to restrain it to win an argument. Values comfort and sense above all else. Has the best sense of direction in the family. Ran ahead on a family hike and locked herself in the car. Demanded an apology from the narrator. Used the Eddie Haskell Ploy to bolster her standing with her parents by making an inevitable decision (not going to an unsupervised party) look like a willing sacrifice. Was allowed by Dorothy Sr. to sit with her friends at a football game. As a three-year-old, she threw a temper tantrum in a bank lobby. Is now a self-directed college junior who aspires to med school. Knew from birth that a good persuader manipulates the audience's feelings. Knew Cicero's dictum that good pathetic argument is understated. Used \"Bambi eyes\" to persuade the narrator. Found the narrator's anger \"funny\" like Yosemite Sam, but his quiet, scary eyes frightening. Practices bantering concession with the television. Used a Heinrichs commonplace (\"You do whatever the hell you want, sweetheart\") at nursery school, which was not shared by the school.",
    "Cicero (Marcus Tullius Cicero): History's greatest orator. Came up with three goals for persuading people: stimulate audience's emotions, change its opinion, get it to act. Believed the most effective rhetoric disguises itself. Divorced his wife of thirty years and married a teenager at sixty. Used digressions to change the tone and rhythm of an argument. Claimed humor was one of the most persuasive rhetorical passions. Believed the appearance of struggling for self-control amplifies the mood. Said a genuine emotion persuades more than a faked one. Believed decorum that works for one persuader may not work for another, even in front of the same people. Taught that one cannot assume a character that strays too far from one's own, stating, \"Indeed, such diversity of character carries with it so great significance that suicide may be for one man a duty, for another (under the same circumstances) a crime.\" Listed decorum first among ethical tactics. Said an audience should be receptive, attentive, and like/trust the speaker. Said you want an audience to be attentive, trusting, and willing to be persuaded. Mentioned a tactic to hype objectivity: seem to deal reluctantly with something you are eager to prove. Believed the appearance of struggling for self-control amplifies the mood. His dictum states that good pathetic argument is understated. His speeches were known for making people say, \"What a great speech,\" leading to agreement rather than commitment. Noted that the Greeks put out several manuals on humor, all unintentionally funny. Banter was his favorite kind of humor, which led to his death.

  "world_state": "Rhetoric is described as a \"three-thousand-year-old art of persuasion.\" John Quincy Adams taught that rhetoric could \"mould the mind of man to the will of the speaker, and yield the guidance of the nation to the dominion of the voice.\" The narrator believes rhetoric teaches how \"to argue without anger\" and offers \"a source of social power.\" Rhetoric is also described as \"the art of influence, friendship, and eloquence, of ready wit and irrefutable logic,\" harnessing \"the most powerful of social forces, argument.\" Argument is pervasive, playing with emotions, changing attitudes, leading to decisions, and encouraging purchases, forming \"a real-life Matrix, the supreme software that drives our social lives.\" Rhetoric serves as argument's decoder. The ancients considered rhetoric the essential skill of leadership, central to higher education, and it helped create the world's first democracies. Rhetoric faded in academia during the 1800s but is now gaining popularity among undergraduates. \"Seduction\" is a form of argument that can lead to \"consensus,\" which is an audience's commonsense thinking or a shared faith in a choice. Faith requires emotion, and logic alone rarely gets people to act; they must desire the act. Argument is inherent in nature, as seen in territorial marking. Figures of speech can yield surprising power. The distinction between fighting and arguing: In a fight, each disputant tries to win; in an argument, they try to win over an audience. Argument aims for agreement, fighting aims for domination. Seduction is a form of argument, the rhetorical opposite of fighting, and a \"good thing\" that manipulates, leading to long-term commitment. Argument by the stick (using fists) never persuades, only inspires revenge or retreat. Cicero's three goals for persuasion are to change the audience’s mood, mind, or willingness to act. These are ordered by increasing difficulty: stimulating emotions (easiest), changing opinion, and getting the audience to act (most difficult). The \"commitment ratio\" is a method to measure if people actually do what you ask them to (divide \"Okays\" by follow-throughs). The \"Goldilocks technique\" is used by retailers, offering lower-priced junk and high-end goods to make mid-priced items seem \"just right.\" Leadership branding coaches teach CEO wannabes to embody their company, emphasizing compelling life stories and desirability over aggression or brains. Corporate recruiters and headhunters look for persuaders and team builders, not aggressors, in executive material. A demagogue is a power-mad dictator who uses rhetorical skills for evil, dreaded by ancient rhetoricians. The South Beach Diet is an example of a successful persuasion campaign using emotional appeal (image of bathing attire/vacation) and \"no-big-deal\" tactics (delicious, doctor-designed, foolproof, fast, healthy weight loss). Rhetorical devices include: - Concession: Rhetorical jujitsu that uses an opponent's moves to one's advantage. (Also called Concessio). - Syncrisis: Reframes an argument by redefining it. - Commonplace: A shared attitude or belief, a building block of persuasion. - Antithesis: An opposing idea, a \"shotgun marriage of contrasting thoughts.\" - Dirimens copulatio: \"A joining that interrupts,\" a form of amplification. - Amplification: A rhetorical tactic that turns up the volume by layering points. - Argumentum a fortiori: \"Argument from strength,\" where if something works the hard way, it's more likely to work the easy way. - Chiasmus: A crisscross figure that repeats a phrase with its mirror image. - Chanticleer fallacy: The logical cheat of assuming A caused B because B followed A. - Enthymeme: Aristotle's \"neat bundle of logic.\" - Prolepsis: Anticipatory concession, agreeing in advance to what the other person is likely to say. - Eristic: The name for debating that seeks to win points. Aristotle's three traits of credible leadership are virtue, disinterest, and practical wisdom. Cicero's five-step method for constructing a speech includes invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Emotion trumps logic. The three basic issues of rhetoric, according to Aristotle, are Blame (dealing with the past), Values (dealing with the present), and Choice (dealing with the future). Any issue involving persuasion can be categorized into one of these. \"Dialectic\" is a type of argument that seeks to discover absolute truth, rather than persuade people. \"Forensic rhetoric\" (judicial argument) deals with the past tense, issues of justice, blame, guilt, and punishment, often used in courtrooms. \"Demonstrative rhetoric\" (epideictic) deals with the present tense, praise and condemnation, values, separating good from bad, distinguishing groups or individuals, and describing those who meet or fail community ideals; it is the communal language of commencement addresses, funeral orations, and sermons, giving a tribal identity. \"Deliberative rhetoric\" deals with the future tense, choices, mutual goals, and \"the advantageous\" (expedience); it is the most pragmatic kind of rhetoric, skipping right/wrong and good/bad in favor of expedience, promising a payoff, and relying on public opinion rather than a higher power. \"Orphan Annie’s Law\" states that a successful argument about the future cannot stick to facts because facts do not exist in the future; it deals with conjecture and choices. \"Argument's Rule Number One\" is to never debate the undebatable (what is permanent, necessary, or undeniably true), but instead to focus on goals. Using the \"conditional mood\" (e.g., \"would\" instead of \"will\") can leave an opening in an argument. The \"extreme choice technique\" involves proposing an extreme choice first to make the desired choice sound more reasonable. \"Digressions\" can be used to change the tone and rhythm of an argument. Phrases like \"What should we do about it?\" and \"How can we keep it from happening again?\" act as \"rhetorical WD-40 lubricant\" to switch arguments to the future tense. \"Anticipatory concession\" (a persuasion alert) involves producing audience objections before they think of them to make listeners more malleable. \"Inarguable\" refers to what is permanent, necessary, or undeniably true; morals are considered inarguable in deliberative rhetoric. \"Control the issue\" is a rhetorical tool to focus an argument on blame, values, or choice, with productive arguments centering on choice. \"Control the clock\" is a rhetorical tool to keep an argument in the right tense, especially the future for debates over choices. Democrats and Republicans are noted for often using the present tense, which is effective for stirring up their base but less so for conducting democracy. Aristotle's three most powerful tools of persuasion are: Argument by character (ethos), Argument by logic (logos), and Argument by emotion (pathos). Rhetoric teaches techniques like the persuasive use of decorum, argument jujitsu, and tactical sympathy. - **Logos**: Argument by logic. Its techniques use what the audience itself is thinking. - **Ethos**: Argument by character. Employs the persuader’s personality, reputation, and ability to look trustworthy. A sterling reputation is persuasive. \"A person’s life persuades better than his word.\" Lying is unpersuasive. In Greek, ethos originally meant \"habitat,\" and it has to do with a person's ability to fit in with a group's expectations. - **Pathos**: Argument by emotion. Appeals to the heart. Forms the root of the word \"sympathy.\" A successful persuader must learn how to read the audience’s emotions. - Logos, ethos, and pathos appeal to the brain, gut, and heart of the audience, respectively, and form the essence of effective persuasion. They usually work together to win an argument. - **Hypophora**: A figure of speech that asks a rhetorical question and then immediately answers it, allowing one to anticipate audience skepticism. - **Concession**: A logical tactic, using the opponent’s argument to one's own advantage. The trick to concession is to find the flip side of every point. - **Sympathy**: A pathetic tactic, registering concern for the audience’s emotions and then changing the mood to suit the argument. It means aligning oneself with the listener’s mood and showing concern. The great orator transforms himself into an emotional role model, showing the audience how it should feel. - **Oversympathizing**: A technique that makes someone’s mood seem ridiculous without actually ridiculing it. - **Backfire**: A technique where an attempt to provoke a negative reaction results in a positive one. - **Decorum**: The concession side of ethos. Defined as the art of fitting in, matching the audience’s expectations for a leader’s tone, appearance, and manners. The Latin word *decorum* meant \"fit\" or \"suitable.\" It is the art of fitting in everywhere, not just polite company. Survival belongs to the decorous. It tells the audience, \"Do as I say *and* as I do.\" The speaker should sound like the collective voice of his audience, a walking, talking consensus. To show proper decorum, one should act the way the audience *expects* one to act, not necessarily like the audience itself. Kenneth Burke declared decorum \"perhaps the simplest case of persuasion.\" Decorum follows the audience’s rules; one cannot be indecorous and persuasive at the same time. It can make the difference between persuading an audience and getting thrown out. Decorum that works for one persuader may not work for another. An ethos that fails to fit one's actual personality is usually indecorous. Decorum is the art of the appropriate. It is a source of rhetorical strength, giving people a sense of group identity. It counts even more in places where the consequences of indecorous behavior are the most dire. It is the better part of valor. Cicero listed decorum first among ethical tactics. - **Argument Tool: DECORUM**: Your audiences find you agreeable if you meet their expectations. - **Persuasion Alert: Aporia**: A rhetorical device where one wonders openly or admits inability to fathom a reason, causing the audience to unconsciously start reasoning for you. Romans saw doubt as a rhetorical device. - **Useful Figure: Dialysis**: A \"this-not-that\" figure of speech, which makes wisdom seem more serious if put cryptically. - **\"Style makes the man\"**: A saying attributed to comte de Buffon, which the narrator refutes, stating, \"Style makes the occasion.\" - **\"Always dress one step above your rank\"**: A piece of advice for career advancement. - **\"The personal is political\"**: A concept particularly relevant for politicians, meaning their private life affects their public perception and persuasiveness. Persuasion does not depend on being true to yourself, but on being true to your audience. - **Deliberative argument**: Is not about the truth, but about choices, and persuasive decorum changes to match the audience. - **The Lincoln Gambit**: A strategy for converting character into a tool of persuasion. - **The Perfect Audience**: An audience that is receptive (sitting still), attentive (willing to listen closely), and well disposed toward you (liking and trusting you). - **Ethos (deeper dive)**: Requires the audience to trust your judgment and essential goodness. Likable knuckleheads make bad leaders. The audience must consider you a good person who wants to do the right thing and will not use them for nefarious purposes. - **Three Traits of Persuasive Leadership (Aristotle's ethos)**: 1.  **Virtue**: The audience believes you share their values. 2.  **Practical wisdom (or street smarts)**: You appear to know the right thing to do on every occasion. 3.  **Selflessness (or disinterest)**: The audience’s interest seems to be your sole concern. - **Virtue (rhetorical)**: Means upholding the values of a group. It does not require purity of soul or universal goodness; one simply must *be seen* to have the audience's values. It changes from audience to audience. Roman *virtus* meant \"manliness\"—good sportsmanship, respect for values, and all-around nobility. - **Persuasion Alert (Interrupting yourself)**: Addressing a different audience (even a virtual one) keeps the original audience on its toes. - **Litotes**: Understates a point ironically. - **Values in deliberative argument**: Used as a tool of ethos, not as a subject of debate. - **Persuasion Alert (Relativism)**: The point of rhetoric is to make one argue more effectively, not to transform one's character. - **Decorum (special kind)**: The ability to match the audience’s beliefs, distinct from clothing or table manners. - **Bragging**: An argument tool to be used only if the audience appreciates boastful hyperbole. - **Character Reference**: An argument tool where others do your bragging for you. - **Tactical Flaw**: An argument tool to reveal a weakness that wins sympathy or shows the sacrifice made for the audience. - **Opinion Switch**: An argument tool where, when an argument is doomed to go against you, you heartily support the other side. A persuader can also pretend they were for the new stand all along. - **The Eddie Haskell Ploy**: An argument tool to make an inevitable decision against you look like a willing sacrifice on your part. - **Rhetorical values**: Do not necessarily represent \"rightness\" or \"truth\"; they merely constitute what people value (honor, faith, steadfastness, money, toys). - **Rhetoric as an agnostic art**: It requires more adaptation than righteousness, adapting to the values of the audience. - **Candidus**: Latin for \"white,\" the root of \"candidates\" and \"candy.\" \"Candid\" used to mean \"openminded.\" - **Ethos enhancer (overwhelming with erudition)**: A common, if ham-handed, method to make an audience take your word for it. - **Rhetoric as awareness and attitude**: More than just technique. - **Practical wisdom (phronesis)**: The second major element of ethos. The audience thinks you know how to solve the problem at hand. It is common sense that can get things done, an instinct for making the right decision on every occasion, and flexibly wise leadership. It is more Edison than Einstein, more Han Solo than Yoda. It does not entail looking up decisions in books or sticking to universal truths. - **Argument Tool: PRACTICAL WISDOM**: The audience thinks you know how to solve the problem at hand. Aristotle’s word for this kind of wisdom is *phronesis*. - **Three tools to get an audience to trust your decision (related to practical wisdom)**: 1.  **Show off your experience**: Experience usually trumps book learning. It is fine to brag about experiences, rather than yourself. 2.  **Bend the rules**: If the rules don't apply, don't apply them, unless ignoring them violates the audience’s values. 3.  **Seem to take the middle course**: Humans instinctively prefer a decision that lies midway between extremes. In an argument, it helps to make the audience think your adversary’s position is an extreme one. - **Proposal structure**: Every proposal should have three parts (not necessarily in this order): payoffs, doability, superiority. - **Inconsistency as a leadership tool**: Keeps the ruler’s subjects off guard (Machiavelli). - **\"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds\"**: A quote used by the narrator. - **Disinterested goodwill**: Aristotle's third ethos asset, combining selflessness and likability. The benevolent persuader shares everything with his audience and makes them believe he has nothing personal at stake, appearing \"free of any special interest.\" - **Disinterest (historical context)**: In earlier times, a reputation for selflessness determined whether a politician got elected. The founders considered rich people the most \"interested.\" Eighteenth-century leaders were anxious to show disinterest, some even gave away their fortunes. This continued into the early nineteenth century with \"log cabin\" stories, showing a man's ability to be beholden to no one. - **Libertas**: Originally meant both freedom and frankness. Free people (those not beholden to a source of income) could speak freely because they were \"disinterested.\" - **Disinterest (modern application)**: Make your audience believe in your selflessness by seeming either wholly objective or nobly self-sacrificing. - **Argument Tool: THE RELUCTANT CONCLUSION**: Act as though you felt compelled to reach your conclusion, despite your own desires. Make it sound as if you reached your opinion only after confronting overwhelming evidence. - **Disinterest technique**: Act as if the choice you advocate hurts you personally. - **Rhetorical virtue**: Can be lost if a leader goes against their nation's values (e.g., Carter's \"national malaise\" speech) or violates notions of fair play (e.g., Nixon's Watergate). - **Practical wisdom**: Demonstrated by breaking old rules when necessary (e.g., Roosevelt's deficit spending during a depression) rather than strictly following traditional rules (e.g., Hoover's budget balancing). Lacking it can lead to poor decisions (e.g., Hamlet following a ghost's directions). - **Goodwill breakdown**: A persuader's poor ethos can make negative, even false, statements about them believable (e.g., Marie Antoinette's \"Let them eat cake\" quote). - **Ethos (deeper dive)**: Counts more than any other aspect of rhetoric because it puts your audience in the ideal state of persuadability (attentive, trusting, and willing to be persuaded). You want them to consider you a role model. - **Rhetorical trickery**: The best trick is to make it seem you have no tricks. - **Quintilian's advice**: A speaker might choose to feign helplessness by pretending to be uncertain how to begin or proceed with his speech, making him appear as an honest man rather than a skilled rhetorician. - **Argument Tool: DUBITATIO**: Don’t look tricky. Seem to be in doubt about what to say. The Romans called this technique *dubitatio*, as in \"dubious.\" It lowers expectations and causes opponents to \"misunderestimate\" you. - **Nervous Speaker Tip**: Use butterflies. An audience will sympathize with a clumsy speaker (a tactical flaw). Gradually speak louder to sound as if you're gaining confidence from the speech's contents. - **Speech openings**: A slow beginning works better than the classic opening joke. Most people start with an attention span of at least five minutes. - **Dubitatio (one-on-one)**: When your partner finishes talking, look down, speak softly and slowly until you're ready to make your main point, then stare intensely into their eyes to convey passionate sincerity. - **Ethos and trickery**: Works best when it disguises its own trickery, even to the point of deliberate ineptness. It requires *performing* personality and reputation, not just \"being yourself.\" Ethos is not karma; it can be started afresh in every argument. - **Ancient Greek preference for plain speech**: Audiences trusted plain-spoken leaders more than skilled ones, preferring \"pure\" Greek over \"fancy\" talk, which they called \"Asian.\" - **Manipulation vs. Sharing in rhetoric**: Rhetoric involves manipulation, but also sharing. - **The Tools (summary of chapter's main points)**: - **Disinterest**: The appearance of having only the best interest of your audience at heart, even to the point of sacrificing for the good of others. - **The reluctant conclusion**: Act as if you reached your conclusion only because of its overwhelming rightness. - **The personal sacrifice**: Claim that the choice will help your audience more than it will help you; even better, maintain that you’ll actually suffer from the decision. - **Dubitatio**: Show doubt in your own rhetorical skill. The plain-spoken, seemingly ingenuous speaker is the trickiest of them all, being the most believable. - **Pathos**: Means more than just \"feelings,\" also refers to physical sensations or suffering. The medical term \"pathology\" comes from it. Affects an audience's judgment, as confirmed by neurological research showing the limbic system (emotions) tends to overpower rational brain parts. Comes from belief, experience, and expectation. Works best at the end of an argument and poorly at the beginning. Should build gradually. Can work subtly in small groups. Is most effective when underplayed, with the persuader appearing to struggle to contain emotions. Requires simple speech, as ornate language belongs to ethos and logos. Less evokes more in pathetic terms. Makes the difference between agreement and commitment. - **\"Pathetic\"**: In classical rhetoric, it was a compliment, meaning the persuader bore the burden of emotion. An argument cannot be rhetorically pathetic unless it is sympathetic. - **Sophists**: Believed pathos affects an audience's judgment. - **Neurological research**: Confirmed the Sophists' theory that the limbic system (seat of emotions) tends to overpower the more rational parts of the brain. - **Emotions**: Come from belief (about what we value, know, and expect). Reality looks different under different emotions. Some emotions (sorrow, shame, humility) prevent action, making people introspective. Other emotions (joy, love, esteem, compassion) work better. Emotions that get an audience to act (anger, patriotism, emulation) arouse people's tribal instincts and require identification. - **Stoics**: Believed pain was the secret to all emotions, with good passions being the absence of pain. - **Storytelling**: The best way to change an audience's mood. It should be vivid, directly involve the speaker or audience, and create a vicarious experience and expectation. Works for every kind of emotion, including humor, and is more effective than name-calling. - **Emotional Volume Control**: A rhetorical tool that advises against visibly exaggerating emotions, instead letting the audience do that for you. Underplaying emotions, in an apparent struggle to contain oneself, gets better results. - **Simple speech**: A pathetic tactic; don't use fancy language when emotional. Ornate speech belongs to ethos and logos; plain speaking is more pathetic. - **Peroration**: The apt time for pathos in a speech. - **Humor**: Ranks high in persuasiveness and improves ethos, calming people and making the speaker appear above petty squabbles. However, it is awful at motivating action, as people rarely want to do anything else when they laugh. - **Fear**: Aristotle called its use a fallacy (\"argument by the stick\") because it compels people to act, and compulsion precludes choice, leaving only naked instinct. - **Identification**: Action requires identification with the speaker and the action promoted. - **Anger**: A person who desires something is especially susceptible to anger if their ability to assuage that desire is frustrated. Young people, the poor, and the sick rouse to anger more easily. The easiest way to stimulate anger is to belittle that desire. It is useful for personal lawsuits, arising from a sense of belittlement. Anger gets the fastest action but is not the best emotion for deliberative argument (decisions about the future) because angry people tend not to think far ahead; it was reserved for courtroom rhetoric. - **The Belittlement Charge**: An argument tool to show your opponent dissing your audience's desires. - **Patriotism**: A rhetorical group loyalty that looks into the future. It is not idealism, but burns for a country (e.g., stars and bars) rather than an idea (e.g., the Constitution). It can be for any group (high school, team, company). It is stirred by comparing the audience with a successful rival group. It is often triggered by something negative, such as when a group is under threat. It has a personal side as a form of competitive jealousy. - **Emulation**: An emotional response to a role model. For it to work, one needs to start with a model the audience already looks up to. It also comes out of an atavistic need to belong. - **The Unannounced Emotion**: An argument tool that advises against advertising a mood in advance, as audiences will resist the emotion if prepared for it. Instead, invoke it, allowing emotions to sneak up on people. - **Group setting**: Most persuasive emotions (humor, anger, patriotism, and emulation) work best in a group setting. A big crowd expects big drama in a speech. - **One-on-one argument**: Logos and ethos are the main strengths, and emotions should not be overplayed. - **Demosthenes vs. Cicero**: Demosthenes (Greek orator) spoke more pathetically, leading to commitment (\"Let's march!\"), while Cicero (Roman orator) led to agreement (\"What a great speech!\"). Emotion makes the difference between agreement and commitment. - **The Tools (summary of chapter's main points)**: - **Belief**: To stir an emotion, use what your audience has experienced and what it expects to happen. - **Storytelling**: A well-told narrative gives the audience a virtual experience—especially if it calls on their own past experiences, and if you tell it in the first person. - **Volume control**: You can often portray an emotion most effectively by underplaying it, in an apparent struggle to contain yourself. - **Simple speech**: Don’t use fancy language when you get emotional. Ornate speech belongs to ethos and logos; plain speaking is more pathetic. - **Anger**: Often arises from a sense of belittlement. You can direct an audience’s fury at someone by portraying his lack of concern over their problems. - **Patriotism**: Attaches a choice or action to the audience’s sense of group identity. You can stir it by comparing the audience with a successful rival. - **Emulation**: Responds emotionally to a role model. The greater your ethos, the more the audience will imitate you. - **Unannounced emotion**: Lets you sneak up on your audience’s mood. Don’t tip them off in advance. They’ll resist the emotion. - **Passive voice**: A thousands-year-old rhetorical device used by scientists to calm passions. It disembody the speaker and removes the actors, making events seem like \"acts of God.\" It can also serve as a political subterfuge. It encourages passivity and calms the audience, making it a pathos trick. It can be used to describe wrongdoing by a friend or coworker while calming the audience, but should not be used when the speaker is the culprit, as audiences may perceive it as \"weaseling out.\" - **Argument Tool: THE PASSIVE VOICE**: Pretend that things happened on their own. - **Backfire**: A technique that inspires sympathy through a *mea culpa* routine that exaggerates the emotions the audience feels. It works best one-on-one, with someone known and liked. It can strengthen client relationships after a screwup by detailing the problem, actions taken to fix it, and expressing self-anger. It is generally ineffective in politics unless the persuader is the widow of a popular, recently deceased incumbent. It is a risky technique because the audience might comply with an exaggerated request. - **Humor**: The best calming device for most emotions, except anger. It relieves anxiety by releasing impulses. Rhetoricians found it hard to teach. -   **Urbane humor**: Depends on an educated audience and relies on wordplay. It is the only kind of humor one can teach oneself. One way to inject it is to invent a neologism that only the audience would understand. -   **Wit**: Drier than urbanity, mildly amusing, and plays off the situation rather than wordplay. -   **Facetious humor**: Covers most jokes, its sole purpose is to make people laugh. Rhetoricians have generally frowned upon it. It can defuse a touchy argument through sheer distraction. -   **Banter**: A form of attack and defense consisting of clever insults and snappy comebacks. The traditional African-American game of snaps is an example. It was Cicero's favorite kind of humor, but it led to his death. In deliberative argument, it works best in defense, using concession to throw an opponent's argument back. It can be practiced by bantering with television. It can also be used in slower forms of communication like mail. - **Neologism**: A newly invented word, which can be used to inject urbane humor into a talk. - **Eristicrats**: A neologism for talk show hosts who engage in eristic (verbal fighting). - **Rhetorical advice on humor**: Do not make jokes about a shocking crime or a pitiful victim. - **The Advantageous**: Base argument on what’s good for the audience, not for the speaker. It is the über-topic of deliberative argument, dealing with choices and the future, and what is best for the audience. - **Babbling**: Aristotle's term for an arguer’s tendency to repeat themselves over and over, which reveals the bedrock of the audience’s opinion. An unpersuadable audience tends to repeat the same rationale. - **The Commonplace**: A viewpoint an audience holds in common, serving as the jumping-off point of an argument. It is a short-form expression of common sense or public opinion, representing beliefs or rules of thumb, not facts. Different groups identify through their commonplaces, which also determine self-identity. It functions as an argument shortcut. - **Topic (rhetorical term)**: From the Greek *topos*, meaning \"place,\" offering points of view. - **The Commonplace Label**: The application of commonplaces to legislation, bumper stickers, and talk radio. It defines an issue in language familiar and comfortable to the audience to capture the higher ground. - **The Rejection**: An audience will often say no in the form of a commonplace, which then becomes the new starting ground for the argument. - **Anadiplosis**: A figure of speech that builds one thought on top of another by taking the last word of a clause and using it to begin the next clause, turning an argument into a \"juggernaut of logic.\" - **Commonplace books**: Collections of practical wisdom kept by students from the Renaissance onward, used in arguments. - **Maxims**: Commonplaces that serve politics, which can be tracked by opinion polls to follow trends in values (e.g., puritanism versus libertarianism).
