  "characters": [
    "Dorothy: The narrator's wife, who returned to full-time work a year and a half ago after the narrator quit his job. She has a fund-raising job at a law school. She is a recipient of a message stating \"You win.\" She is skilled at \"oversympathizing\" to change someone's mood. She was promoted to vice president within eighteen months of resuming her career by dressing one step above her rank on casual Fridays. She puts herself on Dorothy Junior’s side regarding values but hikes because she likes it. She has a good sense of direction. She gave her son, George, his stereo. She made a pact with the narrator not to treat their kids equally, but to love them equally and deal with each situation separately. She allows Dorothy Jr. to sit with friends at a football game. She told George not to speak to his father in a certain way. She uses the backfire technique constantly, specifically oversympathizing with the narrator's mood.",
    "George: The narrator's seventeen-year-old son, who attends a boarding school as a day student. He dislikes school food and his father's stew. He is a recipient of a message stating \"You win,\" specifically winning an argument with his father about toothpaste. As a two-year-old, he was a devotee of \"argument by the stick.\" His name was chosen by his father using a rhetorical trick of proposing extreme alternatives first. At age seven, he insisted on wearing shorts to school in winter and instinctively used character, logic, and emotion to win an argument with his father, specifically using a lower lip stick-out when trying not to cry. He now expresses individuality by wearing ties and pants to school. He believes that meeting a pointless challenge outweighs values like comfort and sense. He asks to sit with friends at a football game but is told no by the narrator and argues it's unfair because Dorothy Jr. was allowed. He tried the \"dubitatio\" technique (looking down, then staring intensely) on a girl while talking politics. He came home in a bad mood and tried to make the narrator angry by announcing the emotion in advance, but was unprepared to get mad himself. He practices bantering with the television, specifically with ads and talking heads. He learned his father's arm-wrestling grip technique and became stronger than his father.",
    "Dorothy Junior: The narrator's daughter, a college student spending a term in London. She is an \"especially difficult adversary\" and \"equally persuasive\" as her brother. She won an argument with her father about where to eat dinner by using his guilt as her emotional goal, demonstrating a biting tongue she knows how to restrain. She values comfort and sense above all else. As a three-year-old, she threw a temper tantrum in a bank lobby in Hanover, New Hampshire. She learned from birth that a good persuader manipulates the audience's feelings, not just expresses her own. She knew the persuader bears the burden of emotion. Her temper tantrum showed the danger of over-displaying emotions. She knew Cicero's dictum that good pathetic argument is understated. As a twelve-year-old, she ran ahead during a family hike, disappeared around a turn, and locked herself in the car with the stereo blasting, having taken the car keys. She made her father apologize to get into the car. In high school, she used the \"Eddie Haskell Ploy\" to bolster her standing with her parents by pretending to sacrifice going to an unsupervised party with alcohol. She is allowed by Dorothy Sr. to sit with friends at a football game. She tells the narrator he should be consistent. She is now a self-directed college junior who aspires to med school. As a child, she expected the narrator to correct her grammar. As a child, she used \"silent peroration\" (tears welling up) and \"Bambi eyes\" (long-lashed open stare) to persuade her father for ice cream. She tells the narrator that his losing his temper never worked on her, but his quiet, scary eyes were frightening. She described the narrator's angry outbursts as a \"Yosemite Sam thing.\" She practices bantering with the television, specifically with ads and talking heads. She answered a request to share a toy at nursery school by saying, \"You do whatever the hell you want, sweetheart.\"",
    "The Author/Narrator: A writer and father of George and Dorothy Junior, married to Dorothy. He lives in a tiny village in northern New England and works in a cabin. He dropped out of a career in journalism and publishing, and was formerly an editorial director at the Rodale publishing company. He is passionate about rhetoric, which he discovered through John Quincy Adams, and wrote this book to teach it. He considers himself a \"confirmed hermit,\" \"persuasion-resistant,\" and \"advertising-immune.\" He is the sender of a \"You win\" message to George. He aims to raise persuasive children. He once carried a coffee mug with \"Piss Off\" on it, which was not well-received in Greensboro, North Carolina. He hired an entry-level editor who had a bumper sticker claiming a local rock band violated \"Your Honor Student.\" He tried to imitate his brother's method of giving a rose to a woman and calling her \"doll,\" but was told \"Go to hell.\" He sought fashion advice from a salesman named Joe in New Hampshire. He believes that meeting a pointless challenge outweighs values like comfort and sense. He once took over a college alumni magazine, turning a deficit into a profit by increasing advertising revenue, but did not receive raises beyond cost-of-living increases because he acted \"businesslike\" while academics valued scholarship. He apologized to his twelve-year-old daughter to get into the car after she locked herself in. He made a pact with Dorothy not to treat their kids equally, but to love them equally and deal with each situation separately. He tells George he cannot sit with his friends at a football game, citing Dorothy Jr.'s age as a reason and Machiavelli's idea of inconsistency. His children see him as practically wise in anything that doesn't involve moving parts, but he lacks virtue in their eyes. He described the \"dubitatio\" technique to his son. He advises nervous speakers to use their butterflies and gradually speak louder. He told his three-year-old daughter her tantrum \"isn't pathetic enough\" and explained that he is a passionate devotee of classical rhetoric. He believes emotion comes from experience and expectation. He is scheduled to testify before the New Hampshire legislature on broadband Internet access in rural areas, where his dial-up connection is so slow a stamped envelope gets delivered faster than e-mail. He was in a \"perverse mood\" when George came home in a bad mood and inoculated himself against George's announced anger. His losing his temper never worked on Dorothy Jr., who found it \"funny\" and called it a \"Yosemite Sam thing,\" but his quiet, scary eyes were frightening to her. Early in his publishing career, he worked for a small magazine that had no fact checkers and mistakenly placed Mount Saint Helens in Oregon in a news piece. He used the backfire technique on his editor, Bill, to confess this mistake. He tries to entertain his unappreciative family with puns. He once lectured on political rhetoric and invented the neologism \"eristicrats.\" He says \"You do whatever the hell you want, sweetheart\" to his children instead of \"Yes\" or \"All right.\" He stopped arm-wrestling his son, George, after George learned his grip technique. He is consulting with a publishing company that is bidding for an airline's in-flight magazine. He uses \"metastasis\" when discussing rhetoric. He once had a rental car scrape in Nice, France.",

He listed decorum first among the ethical tactics. He stated that an audience should be receptive, attentive, and well disposed toward the persuader. His dictum is that good pathetic argument is understated. When he spoke, people said, \"What a great speech.\" He listed compassion as a useful emotion. His favorite kind of humor was banter, and he was famously quick with a comeback, but his ridicule led to him being put on a hit list, literally bantering himself to death.

  "world_state": "Rhetoric is defined as the art of influence, friendship, eloquence, ready wit, and irrefutable logic, and is the art of argument. It is pervasive in daily life, forming a \"real-life Matrix\" of social interaction, and rhetoric serves as its decoder. The ancients considered it the essential skill of leadership, central to higher education, and it helped create early democracies and influenced historical figures and texts. Though it faded in academia in the 1800s, it is regaining popularity. Key rhetorical concepts include Aristotle's three traits of credible leadership (virtue, disinterest, practical wisdom), the idea that emotion often trumps logic, and the goal of consensus (a shared faith in a choice). Seduction, a form of manipulation, is presented as a powerful tool for achieving consensus. Argument is described as inherent in human nature. Figures of speech, such as chiasmus, antithesis, syncrisis, and dirimens copulatio, are powerful rhetorical tools. Cicero's five-step method for constructing a speech includes invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. New rhetorical concepts and distinctions: - **Argument vs. Fight:** In a fight, each disputant tries to win; in an argument, they try to *win over* an audience. Argument aims for agreement, while fighting aims for domination. Successful couples use arguments to solve problems, while doomed couples use them to attack. \"Argument by the stick\" (fighting) never persuades, only inspires revenge or retreat. - **Goals of Persuasion (Cicero's Lightbulb):** The three goals for persuading people, in increasing order of difficulty, are to: 1) Stimulate the audience's emotions (easiest, makes them receptive), 2) Change its opinion, and 3) Get it to act (most difficult, requires stronger emotions and convincing the action is \"no big deal\"). - **The Goal (Argument Tool):** Ask what you want at the end of an argument (change mind, get to do/stop something). Winning means achieving this, regardless of what the opponent thinks. - **Concessio (Concession):** Concede an opponent's point in order to win what you want. It is a powerful Logos tool. - **Prolepsis (Anticipation):** Agreeing in advance to what the other person is likely to say. - **Eristic:** The name for debating that seeks to win points. - **Rhetorical Jujitsu:** Using an opponent's own moves to throw them off balance. - **Goldilocks Technique:** Presenting extreme choices first and last, with the preferred or best-selling option in the middle to make it seem \"just right.\" - **Commitment Ratio:** A measure of whether people actually do what you ask, calculated by dividing \"Okays\" by follow-throughs. - The most effective rhetoric disguises itself. - Ancient rhetoricians dreaded demagogues (power-mad dictators using rhetorical skills for evil), but believed the cure for the dark side of persuasion is the other side. - **Aristotle's Three Core Issues of Rhetoric:** All issues involving persuasion boil down to three categories, each corresponding to a tense: - **Blame (Past Tense):** Deals with issues of justice and determining whodunit. This is called **forensic rhetoric**, and its purpose is to determine guilt and mete out punishment. - **Values (Present Tense):** Handles praise and condemnation, separating good from bad, distinguishing groups and individuals, and creating tribal identity. This is called **demonstrative rhetoric**, used in communal language like commencement addresses, funeral orations, and sermons. Political rhetoric often uses the present tense to stir up a base, which is considered a poor way to conduct a democracy. - **Choice (Future Tense):** Argues about choices and helps decide how to meet mutual goals. This is called **deliberative rhetoric**. Its chief topic is \"the advantageous,\" focusing on expedience rather than right/wrong or good/bad, and promises a payoff. It is the most pragmatic kind of rhetoric. Deliberative argument relies on public opinion to resolve questions, not a higher power. - **Persuasion vs. Dialectic:** Persuasion aims to talk people into things, while dialectic seeks to discover absolute truth. - **Orphan Annie’s Law:** A successful argument about the future cannot stick to facts, as facts do not exist in the future; it deals with conjecture and choices. - **New Rhetorical Tools and Concepts:** - **Controlling the Tense:** Switching the tense of an argument, especially to the future tense, can resolve conflicts and make decisions. - **Proposing an extreme choice first:** Presenting an undesirable option before the preferred one makes the desired option seem more reasonable. - **Digressions:** Used to change the tone and rhythm of an argument. - **Anticipating audience objections:** Producing objections before the audience can think of them makes listeners more malleable. - **Spotting the inarguable:** Identifying what is permanent, necessary, or undeniably true. Deliberative argument prefers to use beliefs to its advantage rather than debating the inarguable. Moral issues and \"eternal truths\" are considered inarguable in deliberative rhetoric, while practical concerns are open to debate. - **Argument’s Rule Number One:** Never debate the undebatable; instead, focus on goals. - **Aristotle's Three Most Powerful Tools of Persuasion:** -   **Logos:** Argument by logic. Uses what the audience itself is thinking. -   **Ethos:** Argument by character. Employs the persuader's personality, reputation, and ability to look trustworthy. A sterling reputation is persuasive. -   **Pathos:** Argument by emotion. Appeals to the heart and is useful for getting people to act. -   **Hypophora:** A figure of speech that asks a rhetorical question and then immediately answers it, used to anticipate audience skepticism. -   **Sympathy:** A pathetic tactic that involves sharing your listeners' mood, registering concern for their emotions, and then changing the mood to suit your argument. -   **Oversympathizing:** A technique that makes someone's mood seem ridiculous without actually ridiculing it. -   **Backfire:** A technique where an attempt to oversympathize or ridicule backfires. -   **Decorum:** The concession side of ethos. - **Decorum:** The art of fitting in; matching the audience’s expectations for a leader’s tone, appearance, and manners. It originally meant \"fit\" or \"suitable\" in Latin. It tells the audience, \"Do as I say *and* as I do.\" It means acting the way your audience *expects* you to act, not necessarily like your audience. It is considered \"perhaps the simplest case of persuasion.\" It is a critical persuasive tool. Indecorous and persuasive are mutually exclusive. It is the concession side of ethos. It is the art of the appropriate. It is an aspect of sympathy. It is the first ethical tactic listed by Cicero. - **Ethos (original Greek meaning):** Originally meant \"habitat\"—the environment animals and people live in. It relates to a person's ability to fit in with a group's expectations. - **Aporia:** A rhetorical device where one wonders openly or admits inability to fathom a reason, causing the audience to unconsciously start reasoning for them. - **Dialysis:** A \"this-not-that\" figure of speech, e.g., \"Don't buy the shoes. Buy the colors.\" - **Argument's Civic Virtue:** Argument can result in peace, love, freedom, and mastery of one's fellow beings. - **Persuasion vs. Being True to Yourself:** Persuasion depends on being true to your audience, not necessarily true to yourself. - **Decorum in Politics:** More complex than in business because the personal is political. - **Decorum in the Senate:** Crucial for maintaining a high state of decorum to prevent political squabbles or civil war. - **Dress Decorum:** Dress the way the average audience member dresses, or slightly above your rank, but not too far above. Don't let clothes make a statement unless the audience agrees with it. - **PowerPoint Presentation Decorum:** Adapting language, posture, and formality for different audiences (department head, VP, COO). - **Writing Decorum:** Checking emails and memos for decorum to meet audience expectations. - **Ethos (expanded):** Requires the audience to trust the persuader's judgment and essential goodness, believing they know the right thing to do and will not use them for nefarious purposes. Aristotle's three essential qualities of persuasive ethos are: **Virtue** (the audience believes you share their values), **Practical wisdom** (you appear to know the right thing to do), and **Selflessness/Disinterest** (the audience's interest seems to be your sole concern). Persuasive virtue does not require purity of soul or universal goodness; it means being seen to have the audience's \"right\" values. Values are a tool of ethos in deliberative argument and change from audience to audience. What seems ethical to one person can hurt another's ethos. To build ethos, one must determine and appear to live up to the audience's values, avoiding judgment of those one wishes to persuade. Rhetoric is an agnostic art, requiring adaptation to audience values, which may include honor, faith, steadfastness, money, or possessions. - **The Perfect Audience:** Is receptive (sitting still), attentive (willing to listen closely), and well disposed toward the persuader (liking and trusting them). - **Litotes:** Understates a point ironically, making for a more sophisticated kind of speech. - **Virtus:** The Roman meaning of \"virtue,\" which meant \"manliness\"—good sportsmanship, respect for values, and all-around nobility. - **Persuasion Alert (Interrupting yourself):** Addressing a different audience (even a virtual one) to keep the original audience engaged. - **Persuasion Alert (Relativism):** The point of rhetoric is to argue effectively, not to transform a person into a better or worse one, even if attaching values to audiences sounds like relativism. - **Bragging:** A rhetorical tool to show how great one is, effective only if the audience appreciates boastful hyperbole. - **Character Reference:** Getting others to brag for you, which Aristotle considered more effective than self-bragging. - **Tactical Flaw:** Revealing a weakness that wins sympathy or demonstrates a sacrifice made for the audience. - **Opinion Switch:** Heartily supporting the opposing side when an argument is doomed to go against you, ideally by showing new information or logic made the switch inevitable. - **The Eddie Haskell Ploy:** Making an inevitable decision against you look like a willing sacrifice on your part. - **Candidus:** Latin for \"white,\" the root of \"candidates\" (who wore white togas to symbolize virtue) and \"candy.\" \"Candid\" also used to mean \"openminded.\" - **Rhetoric's purpose (expanded):** It is as much about awareness and attitude as it is about technique, aiming to build an instinct for persuasion rather than just a set of tools. - **Four ways to pump up rhetorical virtue:** Get a witness to brag for you, reveal a tactical flaw, switch sides when the powers that be do, or use the Eddie Haskell Ploy (throwing support behind the inevitable). - **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis):** The second major element of ethos. It is the appearance of knowing what to do, the audience thinking you know how to solve the problem at hand. It entails common sense that can get things done, an instinct for making the right decision on every occasion, not just sticking to rules or universal truths. It is more Edison than Einstein, more Han Solo than Yoda. It is flexibly wise leadership. - **Three tools to get an audience to trust your decision (related to practical wisdom):** 1) **Show off your experience:** Brag about experiences, not yourself. Experience usually trumps book learning in an argument. 2) **Bend the rules:** If the rules don't apply, don't apply them, unless ignoring them violates the audience’s values. 3) **Seem to take the middle course:** Make the audience think your adversary’s position is an extreme one, and propose a decision that lies midway between extremes. - **Three parts of a proposal:** Payoffs (benefits), doability (ease of doing), and superiority (how it beats other options). These do not necessarily need to be in this order. - The ancient Greeks had far more respect for moderation than modern culture. - Humans in every era instinctively prefer a decision that lies midway between extremes. - Inconsistency is a useful leadership tool, as it keeps the ruler’s subjects off guard (Machiavelli). - Girls mature more quickly than boys. - Sharing an audience's values (virtue) is not sufficient; they also have to believe you know the right thing to do (practical wisdom). - **Disinterested Goodwill:** Aristotle's third ethos asset, combining selflessness and likability, meaning being free of any special interest. Historically, a reputation for selflessness determined political election, with leaders disguising their \"interest\" (e.g., *The Federalist* authors) or claiming impoverished childhoods. \"Libertas\" originally meant both freedom and frankness, allowing \"disinterested\" people to speak freely. - **The Reluctant Conclusion:** An argument tool where one acts as though compelled to reach a conclusion despite personal desires, making it sound like the opinion was reached only after confronting overwhelming evidence. - **Personal Sacrifice:** An argument tool where one acts as if the choice advocated hurts them personally, or helps the audience more than oneself. - **Dubitatio:** An argument tool where one feigns helplessness or doubt about what to say, making them appear honest and sincere rather than a skilled rhetorician. This technique can lower expectations and cause opponents to \"misunderestimate\" you. - For nervous speakers, a tactical flaw is to use butterflies and gradually speak louder to sound like confidence is gained from the speech's content. - Ancient Greek audiences trusted plain-spoken leaders more than skilled ones, preferring \"pure\" Greek over \"Asian\" (fancy) talk. - **The Aquinas Maneuver:** A rhetorical strategy focused on controlling the mood. - **Pathos (expanded):** Means more than just \"feelings\"; also physical sensations (what a person feels or suffers). Done properly, it affects an audience’s judgment, as the limbic system tends to overpower the more rational parts of the brain. Reality looks different under different emotions. It comes from experience and expectation (what the audience believes has happened or will happen). The more vividly an experience is given, the greater the emotion aroused. It works best at the end of an argument and poorly at the beginning. It can work subtly in small groups. It makes the difference between agreement and commitment. - **Pathology:** The medical term for the study of diseases, related to pathos. - **Sophists:** Ancient rhetoricians who said pathos affects an audience’s judgment. - **Emotions (Aristotle's view):** Come from belief about what we value, know, and expect. Can be modified through beliefs. Some emotions (sorrow, shame, humility) can prevent action altogether, making people introspective. Other emotions (joy, love, esteem, compassion) work better. Tribal instincts are useful emotions for action, exploiting insecurities about group standing/belonging. - **Pain:** Considered the secret to all emotions by the Stoics. - **Disbelief:** Can prevent fear. - **Humor:** Ranks highest in persuasiveness, improves ethos, calms people down, and makes the persuader appear to stand above petty squabbles. However, it is awful at motivating action. - **Fear:** Aristotle called its use a fallacy (\"argument by the stick\") because it compels people to act, precluding choice. - **Anger:** Gets the fastest action, but angry people tend not to think far ahead; thus, it is not the best emotion for deliberative argument (decisions about the future). It is useful for courtroom rhetoric. It often arises from frustrated desire or a sense of belittlement. Young people, the poor, and the sick rouse to anger more easily. - **Patriotism:** Does a better job of looking into the future than anger. It is rhetorical group loyalty (for a country, high school, team, or company), not idealism. It is an essentially competitive emotion, often triggered by a rival group's success or when one's group is under threat. - **Emulation:** An emotional response to a role model, stemming from an atavistic need to belong. For it to work, the persuader needs to start with a model the audience already admires. - **Identification:** Action requires identification (with the persuader and the action they promote). - **Rhetorical Tools/Concepts (New or Expanded):** - **Storytelling:** The best way to change an audience’s mood. Make it directly involve you or your audience. A well-told narrative gives the audience a virtual experience, especially if it calls on their own past experiences and is told in the first person. The more vivid the story, the more it seems like a real experience, creating vicarious experience and expectation. - **Emotional Volume Control:** Don’t visibly exaggerate your emotions; let your audience do that for you. Underplaying emotions, in an apparent struggle to contain oneself, can be more effective. Demagogues often begin quietly and gradually increase volume. - **Simple Speech:** Don’t use fancy language when emotional; ornate speech belongs to ethos and logos, while plain speaking is more pathetic. - **Peroration:** The concluding part of a speech, an apt time for pathos. - **The Pathetic Ending:** Emotion works best at the end of an argument. - **The Belittlement Charge:** Show your opponent dissing your audience’s desires. It is the easiest way to stimulate anger. - **Patriotism (as a tool):** Rouse your audience’s group feelings by showing a rival group’s success. - **Emulation (as a tool):** Provide only the kind of role model your audience already admires. - **Unannounced Emotion:** Don’t advertise a mood; invoke it. Tipping off an audience in advance makes them resist the emotion. - **Neurological research:** Confirmed Sophists' theory that pathos affects judgment; the limbic system (seat of emotions) tends to overpower the more rational parts of the brain. - **Ironic time:** The modern era is more ironic, requiring speakers to distance themselves from overly pathetic appeals. - **Adman's presentation technique:** Lowering one's voice gradually to make people lean in, then ending with an emotional crescendo. - **Writing classes dictum:** \"Show, don't tell\" for emotions. - **Inoculation (against emotion):** Giving advance warning of an emotion can make an audience resist it. - **Cicero vs. Demosthenes:** Cicero's speeches elicited \"What a great speech,\" while Demosthenes's speeches prompted \"Let's march!\" This illustrates that emotion makes the difference between agreement and commitment. - **New Rhetorical Tools and Concepts:** *   **The Passive Voice:** A rhetorical device used to calm passions by disembodying the speaker and removing actors, making events seem to happen on their own. It encourages passivity and is a pathos trick. It can be used to describe wrongdoing by others without assigning blame directly, but should not be used when the speaker is the culprit. *   **Backfire (expanded):** A technique to inspire sympathy by exaggerating the emotions the audience feels through a *mea culpa* routine. It works best one-on-one with someone known and liked, and can strengthen relationships after a screwup. It is risky as the audience might comply with an exaggerated request. *   **Humor (expanded):** The best calming device for most emotions, except anger. It relieves anxiety by releasing impulses in a disciplined manner. *   **Urbane humor:** Relies on wordplay and depends on an educated audience. It is the only kind of humor one can teach oneself. *   **Wit:** Drier than urbanity, mildly amusing, and plays off the situation rather than wordplay. *   **Facetious humor:** Covers most jokes, its sole purpose is to make people laugh. Rhetoricians generally frown upon it, but it can defuse a touchy argument through distraction. *   **Banter:** A form of attack and defense consisting of clever insults and snappy comebacks. It works best in rhetorical defense, often using concession to throw an opponent's argument back at them. Cicero's favorite kind of humor, but it led to his death. *   **Banter with concession:** A technique where one accepts an adversary's statement at face value, then follows its logic to a ridiculous conclusion or throws it back with a twist. *   **Emotional Volume Control (expanded):** Demagogues often begin speeches quietly and gradually increase volume. *   **Inoculation (against emotion):** Giving advance warning of an emotion can make an audience resist it. - **The Advantageous:** Base your argument on what’s good for the audience, not for you. It is an outcome that gives the audience what it values. It is the über-topic of deliberative argument, dealing with choices and the future, and talks about what is best for the audience. - Aristotle maintained that the person most affected by a decision makes the best judge of it (e.g., the diner is more qualified to judge a dish than the chef). - The burden of proof in an argument is on the persuader. - To prove a point, start with something your audience believes or wants. - Aristotle was a great believer in corporal punishment and said a slave’s testimony was invalid except under torture. - In politics, the advantageous usually wins in the long run, as statecraft is a selfish art. When arguing for military action, show how your country would benefit. - **Babbling:** Aristotle's term for an arguer’s tendency to repeat themselves over and over, which reveals the bedrock of the audience’s opinion. An unpersuadable audience tends to repeat the same rationale. - **The Commonplace:** A viewpoint your audience holds in common; a short-form expression of common sense or public opinion. It can range from a political belief to a practical matter. Commonplaces represent beliefs or rules of thumb, not facts. People identify with their groups through commonplaces, which also determine self-identity. It is the starting point of an argument. - **Topic:** The word comes from the Greek *topos*, meaning \"place,\" and offers points of view. - Commonplaces work like neural shortcuts, similar to how the brain recognizes a familiar face. - Commonplaces are used by filmmakers as shorthand to express character without unnecessary dialogue or explication (e.g., a two-day beard and whiskey connote an alcoholic; a hero wincing when a woman dabs him with antiseptic shows his sensitive side). - **Rhetorical labeling:** The application of commonplaces to legislation, bumper stickers, and talk radio. - Commonplaces help define a culture and identity (e.g., American commonplaces like freedom, clear skies, healthy forests, life, marriage). - Every commonplace has a potential counter-commonplace (e.g., \"Pro Life\" vs. \"Pro Choice,\" \"Culture of Life\" vs. \"Culture of Freedom\"). - \"Life\" has more pathetic value than \"choice\" in the antiabortion movement. - Commonplaces are powerful weapons and should not be aimed at one's own foot. - Listening for commonplaces can reveal audience values: \"journey\" (adventure/growth), \"kids these days\" (dislikes rap music), \"It's not PC to say this, but…\" (low regard for cultural nuance). - **The Rejection:** An audience will often say no in the form of a commonplace, which then becomes the new starting ground for the argument, provided the argument can continue. - **Anadiplosis:** A figure of speech that builds one thought on top of another by taking the last word of a clause and using it to begin the next clause (e.g., \"For want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a rider the battle was lost…\"). It turns an argument into an \"unstoppable juggernaut of logic.\" - When researching a prospective employer, Google the CEO for catchwords/commonplaces to understand the company's lingo and tone. - **Commonplace books:** Collections of practical wisdom kept by students since the Renaissance, used in arguments. Thomas Jefferson kept them. - Commonplaces are things everybody knows; they become clichés when repeated until people are sick of them. - Tracking commonplaces helps follow trends in values and shifts in public opinion. Opinion polls can track maxims. - Examples of maxims (commonplaces): \"Don't switch horses in midstream\" (after 9/11), \"Americans have a right to privacy in their own home,\" \"We're at war,\" \"It's your thing. Do what you want to do. I can't tell you who to sock it to\" (a few decades ago), \"It's about values\" (early 1990s). - When commonplaces clash, arguments begin. - Mark Twain said public opinion \"is held in reverence\" and \"settles everything,\" with some thinking it is the \"Voice of God.\" - The original definition of \"audience\" meant a \"hearing\" before a king or nobleman; the first audience was a judge. - In deliberative argument, the audience's own beliefs, values, and naked self-interest determine the outcome, not statute books. - To persuade, offer the \"advantageous,\" which is the promise that your choice will give the judges what they value. - Logos makes the audience think that your own opinion is a very small step from their commonplace. - **The Commonplace Label:** Apply a commonplace to an idea, a proposal, or a piece of legislation; anyone who opposes it will risk seeming like an outsider. - **Definition:** A persuasive strategy for getting a favorable grip on an argument, used to define terms and issues in one's favor, and can win an argument without facts. - **Stance (Status Theory):** A fallback strategy for argument: fact, definition, quality, relevance. If facts don't work, redefine terms; if that fails, argue less importance (quality); if that fails, claim irrelevance. This order is descending in preference. - **Redefinition:** A rhetorical tool to not automatically accept an opponent's meaning of a word, but to redefine it in one's favor, making it sound like agreement while undermining the argument. - **Connotation:** The unconscious thoughts that a term sparks in people's minds. - **Denotation:** The literal meaning of a word. - **Labeling:** The rhetorical practice of attaching a pejorative term to a person or concept. - **Definition Jujitsu:** A rhetorical tool to accept an opponent's term and its connotation, then defend it as a positive thing. - **Periphrasis (Circumlocution):** A figure of speech that swaps a description for a name, useful for labeling a person or issue. - **Definition Judo:** A rhetorical tool to use contrasting terms that make opponents look bad. - **Metastasis:** A manipulative figure of speech that skips over an awkward subject. - **Commonplace words:** Key words that form commonplaces and carry emotional weight with an audience. - **Issue:** What an argument is about; every issue has two descriptions. - **Framing:** The same as defining an issue; involves finding a persuadable audience's commonplaces, defining the issue in the broadest context, and then dealing with the specific problem in the future tense. - **Broad context vs. narrow context:** A broad context generally trumps a narrow one in political situations, including office politics. - In politics, \"pro\" usually beats \"con.\" - **Term changing:** A technique to not accept the terms an opponent uses, but to insert one's own. - South Dakota passed a \"draconian law\" banning all abortions regardless of the mother's health or circumstances, which was considered a rhetorical and political mistake.",
  "initial_premise": "The narrator, a writer and proponent of rhetoric, engages in a rhetorical exchange with his son, George, where the narrator tells George, \"You win,\" while internally believing he himself won. This interaction is presented as an example of unresisted persuasion, specifically George switching the argument from blame (past tense) to choice (future tense). A message stating \"You win\" is also addressed to Dorothy (the narrator's wife). The narrator's daughter, Dorothy Junior, also wins an argument with her father about dinner, using guilt as her emotional goal. The narrator also recounts an argument with his seven-year-old son, George, about wearing shorts in winter, where George instinctively used rhetorical tools (character, logic, emotion) to win, leading the narrator to concede. The narrator also describes an incident where his twelve-year-old daughter, Dorothy Junior, locked herself in the car with the keys, forcing him to apologize to gain entry, demonstrating his lack of persuasive virtue in her eyes. Dorothy Junior also successfully uses the \"Eddie Haskell Ploy\" in high school to bolster her standing with her parents by feigning a sacrifice. The narrator's interaction with his three-year-old daughter, Dorothy Junior, during a temper tantrum in a bank lobby, where he told her her argument \"isn't pathetic enough,\" highlights his early and consistent application of rhetorical principles in parenting. The narrator's family values an occasional, skillfully uttered obscenity as a commonplace, with the narrator saying \"You do whatever the hell you want, sweetheart\" to his children, a phrase Dorothy Junior later used at nursery school. The narrator stopped arm-wrestling his son, George, after George learned his grip technique, which the narrator describes as a persuasive strategy of definition.",
